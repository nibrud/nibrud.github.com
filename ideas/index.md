Ideas for stuff nibrud could work on

* a game, maybe with [processing](https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/AVfT3m6WbDv)
* some kind of visualization, maybe with http://processingjs.org or http://www.highcharts.com
* a web app, maybe LastMinute Plans (see http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-03-16#i_5303870 and http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-03-16#i_5304501 ) or something else
